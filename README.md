<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a project inspired by [redux-offline](https://github.com/redux-offline/redux-offline), which works quite well,
but has a big main shortcoming, in that it does not help you manage your optimistic-dependent entities.

Using the go to TODO example, if you create some entities optimistically, e.g. a folder for organising notes, and a note
to go inside the folder:

```
// Optimistic folder entity
{
    id: 1 /* client generated temporary id */,
    folderName: 'My folder name'
}

// Optimistic note entity, linking to the optimistic folder entity (imagine you have a relational database model in your backend service)
{
    id: 1 /* client generated temporary id */,
    folderId: 1 /* references the id from the JSON above, foreign key */,
    noteContent: 'Some note content',
}
```

Then you have created a dependency between an optimistic note and an optimistic folder, where your note now depends on a
temporary id which will most likely get replaced when you actually create the entity in your API. If you don't do
anything about this, once you update your store with the new ID/other values generated by your backend, the relationship
will be broken and your note will reference a non-existent folder.

You could manually manage relationships in your frontend between optimistic entities, but it is much more convenient to
have your optimistic-data framework mostly manage this for you. This lets you use the server-side representation of your
entities (e.g. by foreign keys in a relational database)
without having to duplicate all that effort in your frontend code.

This framework lets you describe relationships between entities, describe how to update the relationships, and all the
state changes are handled for you.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the
acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [redux](https://redux.js.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is a pretty straightforward library, that only requires you to have redux installed as a prerequisite.This project
is purely for managing data in a redux store, so you will need to have redux already installed in your project.

  ```sh
  npm install redux
  ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos
work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_



<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- Support for custom redux-store key other than `offlineQueue`
- Serialisation support/documentation
- Idempotence support via generating unique client-side identifiers to prevent duplicate entities being created for
